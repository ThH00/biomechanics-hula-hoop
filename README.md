## Overview

This repository contains the accompanying code and data for the paper,
submitted in 2026, to the Proceedings of the Royal Society A,
"The Biomechanics of Hula Hooping" by C. Chern, T. E. Honein, and
O. M. O'Reilly.

## Getting Started
Requirements are listed in 'requirements.txt' and can be installed via pip 
using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To reproduce results of the paper, run `run_PCA.py` and `run_Network.py`
in the root directory. For brevity, one example of each analysis is given,
and the code can be straightforwardly modified to produce variants.
For example, modify the `quantities` variable in `run_PCA.py` to produce
PCA analyses of different sets of time series data.

The code in this repository was tested on macOS Version 14.6.1 running
Python 3.12.
